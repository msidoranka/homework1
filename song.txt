Here we come with the roughest and toughest high grade 
sensimilla pumping through our lungs and veins
Never gonna stop till the end of our days
Setting up sound systems with bass for your face
Console shooting out frequency
Full of loops and beats and symmetry
The rooms getting filled with chemistry
Oh let it be, do you see all the energy?
So we keep on moving at a rocksteady pace
We know you gonna want it if you have a little taste
Loosen up your neck and your back and your waist
Feel your self lift as you float into space
Twisting your mind so quick-a-ly
Sonically and telepathically
We’re kissing goodbye to the gravity
Oh let it be, do you feel all the energy?
