Here we come with the roughest and toughest high grade 
sensimilla pumping through our lungs and veins
Never gonna stop till the end of our days
Setting up sound systems with bass for your face
Console shooting out frequency
Full of loops and beats and symmetry
The rooms getting filled with chemistry
Oh let it be, do you see all the energy?
So we keep on moving at a rocksteady pace
We know you gonna want it if you have a little taste
Loosen up your neck and your back and your waist
Feel your self lift as you float into space
Twisting your mind so quick-a-ly
Sonically and telepathically
We’re kissing goodbye to the gravity
Oh let it be, do you feel all the energy?

Western youth be in trouble cause they’re not playing rough
So I try to start a fire with a riddim that’s tough
We need a revolution but we can’t get enough
Of YouTube, FaceBook, InstaGram and that stuff
We need more social activity
Physically in this reality
There's too much digital calamity
Oh let us be what we need for prosperity
But we keep on using up more than we need
And we build on slavery, power, and greed
And I weep every time that I watch TV
So I focus on my Jing and my Shen and my Chi
Soaking up pure infinity
Kundalini shakti for energy
We’re kissing goodbye to negativity
Oh let it be, just free your mentality
